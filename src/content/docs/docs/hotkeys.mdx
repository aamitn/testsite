# Hotkeys

WinHider provides convenient keyboard shortcuts to quickly hide and unhide windows without needing to open the application interface.

## Enabling Hotkeys

Hotkeys can be enabled in three ways:

1. **From the GUI**: Click the "Activate Hotkeys" button in the WinHider GUI
2. **AutoHotkey Script**: Run the included `hide_hotkey.ahk` script (requires AutoHotkey v2+)
3. **Standalone Executable**: Run `hide_hotkey.exe` which is included in the installer and portable versions

## Default Hotkey Bindings

| Hotkey | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Hide the active window from screen sharing |
| `Ctrl+Shift+J` | Unhide the active window from screen sharing |
| `Ctrl+Shift+K` | Hide the active window from taskbar/task switcher |
| `Ctrl+Shift+L` | Unhide the active window from taskbar/task switcher |
| `Ctrl+Shift+I` | Show information about the current window process |
| `Ctrl+F10` | Show/hide the AutoHotkey script tray icon |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Q` | Exit/quit the hotkey script |

## Using Hotkeys Effectively

1. **Focus First**: Make sure to click on the window you want to hide to bring it into focus
2. **Quick Toggling**: Use the corresponding unhide hotkey if you need to make the window visible again
3. **Process Info**: The `Ctrl+Shift+I` shortcut is useful for troubleshooting, as it shows details about the currently active window

## Customizing Hotkeys

If you want to customize the hotkey bindings:

1. Locate the `hide_hotkey.ahk` script in the WinHider installation directory
2. Open it in a text editor
3. Modify the hotkey definitions to your preferred key combinations
4. Save the file and run it with AutoHotkey v2+

Example of customizing a hotkey in the `.ahk` script:

```ahk
; Original hotkey
^+h::RunWait(A_ScriptDir . "\Winhider.exe hide " . "ahk_id " . WinExist("A"))

; Modified to use Alt+H instead
!h::RunWait(A_ScriptDir . "\Winhider.exe hide " . "ahk_id " . WinExist("A"))
```

## Troubleshooting Hotkeys

If hotkeys aren't working:

1. **Check for Conflicts**: Other applications might be using the same keyboard shortcuts
2. **Verify Script Running**: Look for the AutoHotkey icon in your system tray
3. **Run as Administrator**: Some windows require elevated privileges to be modified
4. **Check Window Compatibility**: Some applications with custom rendering may not work with WinHider
