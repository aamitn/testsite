WinHider (short for Window Hider) is an application that allows you to hide user-defined windows from screen sharing applications (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, etc.) and also from the taskbar/task switcher (Alt-Tab).

Originally forked from [radiantly/invisiwind](https://github.com/radiantly/invisiwind), WinHider has been enhanced with additional features and a user-friendly interface.

## What does it do exactly?

WinHider allows you to hide/unhide app windows from screen sharing and taskbar/task switcher while still being able to use and interact with the application on your system.

This is particularly useful when:
- You want to reference notes during a presentation without viewers seeing them
- You need to monitor sensitive information while sharing your screen
- You want to reduce clutter in your taskbar and Alt-Tab switcher
- You need to keep certain applications accessible but hidden from view

## Key Features

- **Hide from Screen Sharing**: Prevent specific windows from appearing in screen sharing applications
- **Hide from Taskbar**: Remove windows from the taskbar and Alt-Tab task switcher
- **Dual Interface**: Use either GUI or CLI based on your preference
- **Hotkey Support**: Quick keyboard shortcuts for hiding/unhiding windows
- **Multiple Installation Options**: Install via Winget, GitHub release, or Microsoft Store
- **Open Source**: Transparent codebase with focus on privacy and security

## Under the Hood

WinHider uses specialized Windows API techniques:

1. **For Screen Sharing Concealment**: 
   - Employs the `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` API with `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` flag

2. **For Taskbar/Alt-Tab Hiding**:
   - Modifies window's extended styles by:
     - Removing `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` style
     - Adding `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` style

3. **Implementation Method**:
   - Uses DLL injection to apply these window modifications
