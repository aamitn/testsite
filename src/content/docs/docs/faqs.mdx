# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What OSes are supported?
Microsoft Windows 10 version 2004 or above. On previous versions of Windows, a black screen shows up instead of hiding the window.

### Do future instances of the application get automatically hidden?
No, each window must be hidden individually. WinHider doesn't automatically hide new instances of previously hidden applications.

### Is it possible to see a preview of the screen on my side?
Yes, you can use OBS Studio with Windowed Projectors:
1. Install [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download)
2. Open OBS and complete first-time setup
3. Right-Click under Sources → Add → Display Capture → OK → Select Monitor under "Display" Dropdown → OK
4. Right-click on the newly created display under sources → Click Windowed Projector
5. Minimize OBS and check for window hide status in projector window
6. Multi-Monitor Systems will not require an additional projector

### Could I automatically hide windows using a hotkey?
Yes! WinHider provides three ways to achieve this:
1. An Autohotkey script named `hide_hotkey.ahk` (requires Autohotkey v2+)
2. A precompiled `hide_hotkey.exe` (no additional software required)
3. The "Activate Hotkeys" button in the GUI

## Technical Questions

### Why doesn't hiding work for some applications?
Some applications use special rendering methods that bypass the standard Windows display pipeline. Applications with hardware acceleration or custom rendering might not work with WinHider.

### Does WinHider work with remote desktop or virtual machines?
Results may vary. WinHider is primarily designed for local Windows installations. Remote desktop sessions may not fully support all the Windows API features that WinHider uses.

### Is WinHider compatible with Windows 11?
Yes, WinHider is fully compatible with Windows 11.

### Will WinHider work with any screen sharing application?
WinHider works with most mainstream screen sharing applications like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Discord, and others that use standard Windows capture methods.

## Privacy and Security

### Does WinHider collect any data?
No, WinHider does not collect any data. It's a completely offline application with no telemetry or data collection.

### Is it safe to use?
Yes, WinHider is open source, and the code is available for review on GitHub. It only uses documented Windows APIs to achieve its functionality.

### Can others tell that I'm using WinHider?
No, there's no indication to other users that you're using WinHider. The windows simply don't appear in the screen share.
