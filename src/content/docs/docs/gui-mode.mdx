# GUI Mode

WinHider provides a user-friendly graphical interface that makes it easy to hide and unhide windows.

## Starting the GUI

Launch `WinhiderGui.exe` from the installation directory or from the Start Menu if you installed WinHider using the installer.

## Main Interface

The GUI interface includes:

1. **Target Window Selection**: Click "Select Window" to choose which window to hide
2. **Hide/Unhide Options**: Choose between hiding from screen sharing, taskbar, or both
3. **Action Buttons**: Apply the selected hiding options to the target window
4. **Window List**: View and manage currently hidden windows
5. **Hotkey Controls**: Enable/disable keyboard shortcuts

## Step-by-Step Usage

### Hiding a Window

1. Launch the application you want to hide (e.g., Notepad)
2. Open WinHider GUI
3. Click the "Select Window" button
4. Click on the window you want to hide (your cursor will change to a targeting icon)
5. Choose the hiding options:
   - "Hide from Screen Share"
   - "Hide from Taskbar"
   - Or select both options
6. Click "Apply" to hide the window

### Unhiding a Window

1. In the WinHider GUI, find the window in the list of hidden windows
2. Select the window from the list
3. Click "Unhide" to restore its normal visibility

## Using Hotkeys

The GUI allows you to activate hotkeys for quick access to WinHider functions:

1. Click the "Activate Hotkeys" button in the GUI
2. Now you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+H`: Hide the active window from screen sharing
   - `Ctrl+Shift+J`: Unhide the active window from screen sharing
   - `Ctrl+Shift+K`: Hide the active window from taskbar/switcher
   - `Ctrl+Shift+L`: Unhide the active window from taskbar/switcher
   - `Ctrl+Shift+I`: Show information about the active window
   - `Ctrl+F10`: Show/hide the hotkey script system tray icon
   - `Ctrl+Shift+Q`: Exit the hotkey script

## Advanced Options

The GUI also provides additional options accessible from the menu:

- **File**: Exit the application
- **Edit**: Preferences and settings
- **Help**: Access help documentation and about information

## Troubleshooting

If a window doesn't hide properly:
1. Try closing and reopening WinHider
2. Ensure you have administrator privileges
3. Check if the target application is running as administrator (WinHider needs matching privileges)
4. Some applications with special rendering methods may not be compatible
